The neural network is said to be based on the way the human brain functions; however, this is far from the truth. Brains are way more complicated and efficient than neural networks.

Neuromorphic means \"like the brain.\" Dedicated circuits are used to mimic the way dynamic cells in the brain operate. They do not run any programs but are capable of learning, and just like actual brain cells, they all work simultaneously rather than sequentially. Neuromorphic cortical models of artificial intelligence are based on the structure and function of the neocortex, the brain's outer region responsible for complex cognitive processes and are small, faster and less power-hungry than computers.</p>,\n",
